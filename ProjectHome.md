`webapp2` is a lightweight Python web framework compatible with Google App
Engine's [webapp](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/).

`webapp2` is [simple](http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/source/browse/webapp2.py). it follows the simplicity of `webapp`, but improves it in some ways: it adds
better URI routing and exception handling, a full featured response object and
a more flexible dispatching mechanism.

`webapp2` also offers the package
[webapp2\_extras](http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/#api-reference-webapp2-extras)
with several optional utilities: sessions, internationalization, domain and
subdomain routing, secure cookies and others.

webapp2 can also be used outside of Google App Engine, independently of the
App Engine SDK.

For a complete description of how webapp2 improves webapp, see
[webapp2 features](http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/features.html).
